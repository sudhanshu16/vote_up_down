   Theming widgets and votes
   =========================
    Since widgets are implemented through plugins, and we have many plugins
    to choose at runtime, we can not use direct theme templates, so instead
    we render by hands the templates.

    NOTE: It is not possible to decide dynamically the path where the
    template is located. In contrast we can dynamically define function and
    template names.

    So, before rendering the template('widget.tpl.php' or 'votes.tpl.php') we
    verify in the following order the files:

    This templates can be located on the root of your theme folder or inside
    your widget folder(not really recommended).

<!--- These needs to be changed but putting them as it as for now --->

How to display voting widget by API for nodes?::
If you want to custom how and where to show the widget, you need to
render manually each part of the standard node `$content` variable
(fields, body, etc).
+
[source,php]

<?php
// save the rendered value of the widget
$vud_widget = $node->content['vud_node_widget_display']['#value'];
// avoid show it twice
unset($node->content['vud_node_widget_display']);

// render each value inside $content
print $node->content['body']['#value'];

// print vud widget, here is the place where we want to show it
print $vud_widget;

// render more values inside $content

How can I prevent bots to vote when anonymous voting is enabled?::

file to prevent bots to vote.
